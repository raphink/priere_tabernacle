I John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

\section{Brazen Laver – Place of cleansing (meditating the Word of God)}



\begin{quote}
...Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.

\raggedleft\small Ephesians~5:25-27

Ask the Lord to cleanse you from sin, meditate on His Word. Remember the many promises that He has given us in His Word.

\section{Golden Lampstand\\Jesus the light of the world)}

John 8:12 – “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”

II Corinthians 4:6 – “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”

Matthew 5:16 – “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”

Take the time to pray for all the ministries that God puts on your heart. For the church, pastors and the leadership of the church, Bible study groups, prayer groups, missionaries... 
\section{Table of showbread) (personal needs)}

John 6:35 – “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.”

\section{Golden Altar of Incense (intercession)}

Psalm 141:2 – “Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.”

Incense was offered daily, just as we are to pray daily and without ceasing.

Take time to intercede for others


\section{Holy of Holies (adoration)}

Only one man (the High Priest) was permitted to enter the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). The Veil that separated the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies represented the barrier between God and man. When Jesus died on the cross, the veil was miraculously torn in two. Thank God that through Jesus' sacrifice salvation is extended to all, and anyone can enter into God’s presence and commune with Him.

Take time to worship Him in spirit and tin ruth!
